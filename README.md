# Electromagnetic heating of rocky planets

This repo provides simulated data and preprocessing scripts to calculate and visualize electromagnetic heating effects of TRAPPIST-1 planets due to flare/CMEs effects. This is meant to support this publication (accepted [manuscript](Accepted_manuscript.pdf) can also be found in thisrepository)
